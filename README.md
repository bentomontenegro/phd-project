# Bento Montenegro's PhD project

This repository is intended to publicly share Qiskit implementations of the main tools I'm using in the development of my PhD project, such as

1. Unitary time evolution
2. Quantum trajectories
3. Ancillary alternatives to implement non-unitary evolutions in Qiskit
4. Noisy and noise-free simulations of these two last concepts

Of course not all information about the project is given, but hopefully the codes and their explanation can help those who are trying to implement similar concepts.

Any suggestions, PR's or comments are more than welcome.
